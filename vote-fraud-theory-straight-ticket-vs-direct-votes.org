* background

While the 2020 election is behind us, this is not the case with interpretations. Theories
abound proposing how and why we can /know/ that fraud is the overwhelming conclusion. One
such theory is contained in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRJCB6U-H4E][this video]] by a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva_Ayyadurai][Dr. Shiva]]. The gist goes like this:
- in certain states, one may vote "straight ticket," which means making one choice to
  select all same-party candidates on the ballot
- one may also "direct vote," meaning one makes individual choices (which may or may not
  be for all same-party candidates)
- for a given party, there is an expected correlation between the percent of straight
  ticket votes in an area (e.g. precinct, county) and direct votes for others of the same
  party; deviating from this correlation implies fraud

Let's take a look!

Several early warning signs stood out to me ahead of actually digging into the proposed theory:

- MIT is slapped all over this, which I thought implied he was faculty until I re-looked
  in order to write this post.

- he includes a long preface citing his pedigree, degrees, and Fullbright scholarship
- the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva_Ayyadurai][wiki page]] on him refers to a past history of promoting conspiracies, and falsely
  claiming to have invented email
- his personal behavior after losing an election is [[https://web.archive.org/web/20201115165853if_/https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/ikyqep/shiva_is_an_unhinged_maniac_and_inciting_violence/][less than stellar]]

Nevertheless, we can take the data and reasoning on their own merits, though I think past
credibility and general conduct is relevant data to consider.

* the lead in

Dr. Shiva's strategy begins by planting seeds of doubt. For example, here he points out
the lack of traceability and verification abilities for voters:

#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[img-url:/blog/img/shiva_doubt.png]]

He presents the aility of General Election Management System (GEMS) software to use
weighted votes (where a vote != 1), and to apparently display/calcualte fractional
votes. [[http://blackboxvoting.org/fraction-magic-2/][This work]] has been done by Black Box Voting, and led me down a bit of a rabbit
hole, and I admit that the wiki page on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_Election_Solutions][Premier Election Solutions]] doesn't instill
confidence, but this is a far cry from the type of investigation and evidence one would
need to show that any of these features or vulnerabilities was used to alter results.

Next, we're shown a table that supposedly comes from FOIA requests for various towns in
Massachusetts, showing that the number of votes recorded in the MA 2020 primary election
exceeded the number of voters on "participating voter lists" for 15 cities/downs he
audited.

[[img-url:/blog/img/shiva_excess-votes.png]]

Note that the raw data isn't provided, no context is given (what is a "participating voter
list"?), and we have no input from anyone in MA government to comment. Could the list be a
past snapshot of prior registered voters compared with actual tallied voters (which
include [[https://www.boston.gov/departments/elections/how-register-vote][late-registered]] voters)? The point is, we don't know. One can suspect all sorts of
things, but how can we say what this means conclusively?

On top of that, trying to look around for this reveals [[https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-table-voter-registration-st/fact-checktable-shows-outdated-voter-registration-numbers-for-eight-key-states-idUSKBN27L2Y8][plenty of]] fact-checking [[https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-wisconsin-vote-vs-voters-afs:Content:9672223878][responses]]
to claims like this, namely that there were [[https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/voter-fraud-more-votes-voters-2020/][more votes than voters]]. Sure, /could be/, but
we'd need more and we don't have it. These excess vote investigations, by the way, were
obtained via his insistence on voter fraud to [[https://shiva4senate.com/election-fraud/][explain his loss]] when running in the
MA primary for [[https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/election-results/massachusetts-primaries-2020/][state senator]]. When he lost, he filed a request to see ballot images, was told
that only the original ballots are kept per law, and he began [[https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201101/16264445627/shiva-ayyadurais-lawsuit-against-massachusetts-official-actually-raises-interesting-1st-amendment-question-about-election.shtml][falsely claiming]] MA was
destroying ballots on twitter (and [[https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/09/06/howie-carr-good-thing-shiva-isnt-taking-his-gop-primary-loss-personally/][ranting via bullhorn]] in the streets). When his posts
were taken down, he sued for $1.2B in damages...

Moving on, he moves on to discussing what % votes over time during an election should look
like, using this example from Franklin county, which settles in early and stays constant:

#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[img-url:/blog/img/shiva_franklin-county.png]]

He then compares this to a "suspect" plot, which he says diverges:

#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[img-url:/blog/img/shiva_suspect-county.png]]

There are a few problems with this. 
- note how close Franklin is to 50/50 and that the margin is <10%, as votes come in (which
  can be thought of as   randomly sampling the population), further sampling will not
  drastically affect the net result if the true breakdown is something like 47% vs. 53%. 
- in the second graph, the margin between red/blue is >25%, so one would expect that early
  sampling will not reflect the end state (mandating divergence). In other words, in a bag
  with 600 blue marbles and 350 red, the early results will start much closer to 50/50
  before settling in to their truer distributions
- the lines are smooth for Franklin and the x-axis is shown; the lines are jittery for the
  other county, and we are not shown the x-axis. This tells me that we are seeing an
  early, zoomed in view and one might see what looks like relatively wonky behavior if
  zooming into Franklin for <500 votes, too.
- as more of a continued gut feeling/indirect assessment about what I'm seeing, the plots
  are pictures of a computer screen vs. included directly in the presentation, which is
  weird for MIT PhD standards

I admit I didn't watch the full end of this video, so I'm not sure if these patterns are
revisited, but they originate from [[http://www.electoralsystemincrisis.org/2016-democratic-primary-graphs][the work of Phil Evans]]. Having skimmed this... I find
it bizarre. I would describe the entire hypothesis as: "I can't explain reality, therefore
fraud."
