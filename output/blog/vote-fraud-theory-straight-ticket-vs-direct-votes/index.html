While the 2020 election is behind us, this is not the case with interpretations. Theories
abound proposing how and why we can <i>know</i> that fraud is the overwhelming conclusion. One
such theory is contained in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRJCB6U-H4E">this video</a> by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva_Ayyadurai">Dr. Shiva</a>. The gist goes like this:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>in certain states, one may vote "straight ticket," which means making one choice to
select all same-party candidates on the ballot</li>
<li>one may also "direct vote," meaning one makes individual choices (which may or may not
be for all same-party candidates)</li>
<li>for a given party, there is an expected correlation between the percent of straight
ticket votes in an area (e.g. precinct, county) and direct votes for others of the same
party; deviating from this correlation implies fraud</li>
</ul>
<p>
Let's take a look!
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>
Several early warning signs stood out to me ahead of actually digging into the proposed theory:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>MIT is slapped all over this, which I thought implied he was faculty until I re-looked
in order to write this post.</li>
</ul>
<p width="500">
<img src="../../img/shiva_intro_creds.png" alt="nil"></p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>he includes a long preface citing his pedigree, degrees, and Fullbright scholarship</li>
<li>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva_Ayyadurai">wiki page</a> on him refers to a past history of promoting conspiracies, and falsely
claiming to have invented email</li>
<li>his personal behavior after losing an election is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201115165853if_/https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/ikyqep/shiva_is_an_unhinged_maniac_and_inciting_violence/">less than stellar</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Nevertheless, we can take the data and reasoning on their own merits, though I think past
credibility and general conduct is relevant data to consider.

Dr. Shiva's strategy begins by planting seeds of doubt. For example, here he points out
the lack of traceability and verification abilities for voters. I don't disagree, I just
disagree that this is somehow novel this year in particular.
</p>

<p width="500px">
<img src="../../img/shiva_doubt.png" alt="nil"></p>

<p>
He presents the aility of General Election Management System (GEMS) software to use
weighted votes (where a <code>vote != 1</code>), and to apparently display/calcualte fractional
votes. <a href="http://blackboxvoting.org/fraction-magic-2/">This work</a> has been done by Black Box Voting, and led me down a bit of a rabbit
hole. I admit that some aspects of the wiki page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_Election_Solutions">Premier Election Solutions</a> doesn't instill
confidence, but this is a far cry from the type of investigation and evidence one would
need to show that these features or vulnerabilities were used to alter results.
</p>

<p>
Next, we're shown a table that supposedly comes from FOIA requests for various towns in
Massachusetts, showing that the number of votes recorded in the MA 2020 primary election
exceeded the number of voters on "participating voter lists" for 15 cities/downs he
audited.
</p>

<p width="500px">
<img src="../../img/shiva_excess-votes.png" alt="nil"></p>

<p>
Note that the raw data isn't provided, no context is given (what is a "participating voter
list"?), and we have no input from anyone in MA government. Could the list be a
past snapshot of prior registered voters compared with actual tallied voters (which
include <a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/elections/how-register-vote">late-registrations</a>)? How do they calculate these numbers? Is the same group/entity
providing both numbers? The point is, we don't know. One can suspect all sorts of
things, but how can we say what this means conclusively?
</p>

<p>
On top of that, trying to look around at this issue reveals <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-table-voter-registration-st/fact-checktable-shows-outdated-voter-registration-numbers-for-eight-key-states-idUSKBN27L2Y8">plenty of</a> fact-checking <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-wisconsin-vote-vs-voters-afs:Content:9672223878">responses</a>
to claims like this, namely that there were <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/voter-fraud-more-votes-voters-2020/">more votes than voters</a>. Sure, <i>could be</i>, but
we'd need more and we don't have it. These excess vote investigations, by the way, were
obtained via his insistence on voter fraud to <a href="https://shiva4senate.com/election-fraud/">explain his loss</a> when running in the
MA primary for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/election-results/massachusetts-primaries-2020/">state senator</a>. When he lost, he filed a request to see ballot images, was told
that only the original ballots are kept per law, and he subsequently began <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20201101/16264445627/shiva-ayyadurais-lawsuit-against-massachusetts-official-actually-raises-interesting-1st-amendment-question-about-election.shtml">falsely
claiming</a> on twitter that MA destroying ballots (and <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/09/06/howie-carr-good-thing-shiva-isnt-taking-his-gop-primary-loss-personally/">ranting via bullhorn</a> in the
streets). When his posts were taken down as disinformation, he sued for $1.2B in damages…
</p>

<p>
Moving on, he begins discussing what % votes over time should look like, using this
example from Franklin county, which settles in early and stays constant: 
</p>

<p width="500px">
<img src="../../img/shiva_franklin-county.png" alt="nil"></p>

<p>
He then compares this to a "suspect" plot, which he says diverges suspiciously:
</p>

<p width="500px">
<img src="../../img/shiva_suspect-county.png" alt="nil"></p>

<p>
There are a few problems with this. 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>note how close Franklin is to 50/50 and the margin is &lt;10%. As votes come in (which
can be thought of as randomly sampling the population), further sampling will not
drastically affect the net result if the true breakdown is something like 47% vs. 53%.</li>
<li>in the second graph, the margin between red/blue is &gt;25%, so there's no way that early
ratios will reflect the end state (mandating divergence). In other words, in a bag 
with 600 blue marbles and 350 red, the early results will start much closer to 50/50
before settling at their true distribution</li>
<li>the lines are smooth for Franklin and the x-axis is shown; the lines are jittery for the
other county, and we are not shown the x-axis. This tells me that we are seeing an
zoomed in view. Franklin county would look pretty wonky we zoomed in on &lt;500 votes, too.</li>
<li>as more of a continued gut feeling/indirect assessment about what I'm seeing, the plots
are pictures of a computer screen vs. included directly in the presentation, which is
lower than I expect for MIT PhD standards</li>
</ul>
<p>
I admit I didn't watch the full end of this video, so I'm not sure if these patterns are
revisited, but they originate from <a href="http://www.electoralsystemincrisis.org/2016-democratic-primary-graphs">the work of Phil Evans</a>. Having skimmed this… I find
it bizarre. I would describe the entire hypothesis as: "I can't explain reality, therefore
fraud." Really, take a look yourself:
</p>

<p width="500px">
<img src="../../img/shiva_phil-evans-al.png" alt="nil"></p>

<p>
I think I'll revisit this at a later time in more detail, as this isn't at the heart of
Dr. Shiva's argument. For now, here's the synopsis of the method from <a href="http://www.electoralsystemincrisis.org/">his report</a>:
</p>

<pre class="example">
The technique [Cumulative Precinct Vote Tally Chart, CVT] is based on the Law of Large
Numbers. Investopedia provides a straight-forward explanation, “A principle of probability
and statistics which states that as a sample size grows, its mean will get closer and
closer to the average of the whole population.” 

The CVT graph shows the precincts added together cumulatively from the smallest to the
largest along the X-axis. On the Y-axis it shows the two candidates’ percentages.
</pre>

<p>
The problem is, the heavy R leaning in small, rural areas, and strong D leaning in cities
is well known. Depending on a state's overall population, ratio of total city 
vs. total rural population, overall leaning, and the dynamics of each year's candidates… these
kinds of curves could literally be <i>anything</i> when plotted from smallest to largest precinct.
</p>

<p>
In the AL example above the dotted reference lines amount to this hypothesis: "the end
results should be about the same as the result very early." But the problem in expecting
convergence "closer and closer to the average of the whole population," is that the
population is bi-modal. Here's the 2020 county level breakdown for the 2020 presidential
election in Alabama (62.1% Trump vs. 36.5%):
</p>

<p width="500px">
<img src="../../img/shiva_alabama-county-2020-pres.png" alt="nil"></p>

<p>
By exploing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-alabama.html">the NY Times results for AL</a>, Jefferson County (Birmingham) was 55.7% Biden vs. 42.6% Trump, with
over 300k votes. Surrounding counties favored Trump anywhere from 75/25% to 95/5%, but
with populations of 7-40k. This doesn't even pass the smell test. The state is
not one bag of marbles; you're sampling n times from one bag containing 90 red
and 10 blue, then switching to a much different bag and sampling 10x the number of times.
</p>

<p>
I happen to have the county level presdential election results, so here's Alabama to show
exactly what I mean:
</p>

<p width="500px">
<img src="../../img/shiva_perc-vs-votes_al.png" alt="nil"></p>

<p>
I hope to come back to this in detail some other time, but for now I wanted to illustrate
preliminary thoughts on his collaborator's idea.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org48fd43a">
<p>
Here is the central theory presented, which has already (4 days later as of now) been
parroted around as <a href="https://joannenova.com.au/2020/11/electronic-vote-fraud-equation-revealed-in-michigan-in-4-counties-138000-fake-votes-for-biden/">proof of 69,000</a> switched votes (or <a href="https://joannenova.com.au/2020/11/electronic-vote-fraud-equation-revealed-in-michigan-in-4-counties-138000-fake-votes-for-biden/">is it 138,000</a>?).
</p>

<p width="500px">
<img src="../../img/shiva_st-vs-direct-theory.png" alt="nil"></p>

<p>
The observation works like this:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>in various Michigan precincts, they looked at straight party % (percent of voters
choosing to vote straight-R) vs. % Trump votes for those who did <i>not</i> vote straight-R
(referred to as direct votes)</li>
<li>on the x-axis is straight-R %</li>
<li>on the y-axis is Trump % among direct votes minus straight-R %</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is what Dr. Shiva says these plots should look like:
</p>

<p width="500px">
<img src="../../img/shiva_st-expected.png" alt="nil"></p>

<p>
The layman's explanation is that straight-R % in a precinct is a measure
of "republican-ness." If you have a very high % of straight-R voters, the precinct
population is very R loyal. For the direct voters, should expect this loyalty to be
similar, so you should expect a constant offset. So among direct voters, Trump support
might vary +/-10% vs. the straight-R %, and that level will be consistent across all
state's precincts.
</p>

<p>
Compare this to what he presents as a suspect precinct:
</p>

<p width="500px">
<img src="../../img/shiva_st-suspect.png" alt="nil"></p>

<p>
He points out that the fit line features an early plateau and then a steep
decline. Similar to Phil Evans' theory, the claim is that Trump's positive margin in low
straight-R % precincts should be representative of the whole population and carry across
the board. He doesn't show his work, but I think he uses the early plateau vs. the
downward trend line to calculate and estimate of ~40k lost votes. Is this reasonable? Not remotely.
</p>

<p>
For one, what are we really plotting? We have <code>y-x</code> vs <code>x</code>; what should that
look like? For both straight-R and direct-R voters, we have a range of 0-100%. The cells
below show what the extremes of <code>y</code> will be for each combination (direct-R - straight-R):

<p>
Before we apply <i>any</i> background knowledge or data analysis to this, we know that we
have an inherent relationship in the data because of how he's chosen to plot it:
</p>

<p width="500px">
<img src="../../img/shiva_st-vs-dir.png" alt="nil"></p>

<p>
One can intuitively see this, as well. In a county with <i>no</i> straight-R votes… surely
<i>someone</i> will vote for Trump, right? Thus <code>direct-R - straight &gt; 0</code>. As we increase in
straight-R votes, two things happen:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>straight-R % begins to exceed the general population sentiment (90% straight-R is higher
than Trump support at large), so the chance of direct-R &lt; straight-R increases</li>
<li>in addition, high straight-R % means a very <i>low</i> relative number of direct voters, so
the denominator becomes small, and even a few Biden votes makes for a much lower direct-R
%.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The last point is key: say we have 100 voters in a 90% straight-R precinct. This only
leaves 10 direct voters, and imagine that 3 vote for Biden. This precinct is <i>97% Trump</i>
(90 direct + 7 direct out of 100), however due to the choice of this metric, it will show
a -60% Trump "hit" (30% direct - 90% straight). Can you see how this graph isn't what it
seems? I didn't see how they calculated "stolen" votes, so I would be curious if they
factor in the small direct-R population (loss of 3 votes?) or consider the "deficit" vs
the total voters (a loss of perhaps 60 votes).
</p>

<p>
This premise also ignores that as you increase in straight-R percentage, some of those
choosing to vote direct are <i>specifically doing it to vote against Trump</i>. That is to say,
the direct voting group <i>is expected</i> to lean more toward Biden than the overall straight-R
percent.
</p>

<p>
Next, Wayne county is shown as an example where "the algorithm" is not detected, and where Trump
even managed a "boost" of 10%:
</p>

<p width="500px">
<img src="../../img/shiva_wayne-county.png" alt="nil"></p>

<p>
This is followed by showing Kent county, where the algorithm is alive and well:
</p>

<p width="500px">
<img src="../../img/shiva_kent-county.png" alt="nil"></p>

<p>
But note the axes. At a guess, I'd say 80% of Wayne county precincts are &lt;10% straight-R
voters, and the axis stops at 35%. Kent county goes all the way up to 80% straight-R, and
the axis extends to 100%. Look at Kent straight-R &lt; 35%, right where the elbow is in the
fit line. That's essentially where all of Wayne county's data is. It's not "the algorithm"
that isn't at play; the precincts are simply below high straight-R territory where we
the pre-determined mathematical pattern will <i>always</i> be observed.
</p>

<p>
This is also good point to show a corollary. What about that Trump "boost"? As the
straight-R percent declines, you descend below the general population sentiment, so you're
bound to have a higher Trump % among direct voters than the straight-R %. Wayne county was
30.7% Trump, which is much higher than the 0-10% straight-R % for most precincts.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org24b51bd">
<p>
My favorite approach to these things is to just try them myself. Can we? Straight ticket
data seems sparse, but I managed to find <a href="https://sites.austincc.edu/newsroom/2008/12/11/cppps-releases-straight-ticket-voting-report/">a report</a> with data from Texas. It covered
straight ticket votes in 47 counties amounting to 83% of the overall Texas votes in 2008
(<a href="https://www.austincc.edu/cppps/pdfs/straightticketfinalreport.pdf">pdf</a>). Without <i>too</i> much work, I extracted the main table with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poppler_(software)#poppler-utils"><code>pdftotext</code></a>, pasted it
into a spreadsheet, and paired it with the overall TX <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas#By_county">results per county</a> (<a href="https://jwhendy.github.io/data/shiva_tx-straight-vs-direct_2008.csv">data</a>). Plotting
with their method, what do we find?  
</p>

<p width="500px">
<img src="../../img/shiva_tx-st-vs-dir.png" alt="nil"></p>

<p>
In light of Dr. Shiva's following conclusion, consider that this is Texas, which had an
overall result of 55.5% McCain to 43.7% Obama in 2008:
</p>

<p width="500px">
<img src="../../img/shiva_conclusion.png" alt="nil"></p>

<p>
Surely the argument isn't that McCain won Texas by fraud (Obama's trend is lower and
therefore shows that "the algorithm" took more of his votes)? Or that that
algorithm was stealing votes from both (why would they <i>both</i> follow this suspicious,
downward trend)? And why did the algorithm kick in so early with the independent
candidates? For what it's worth, FiveThirtyEight <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FiveThirtyEight#Final_projections_of_2008_elections">was extremely accurate</a> in 2008, and Texas
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204075833/http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/11/todays-polls-and-final-election.html">wasn't even listed</a> as a swing state. Why risk cheating when you don't need to?
</p>

<p>
Indeed, none of these things make sense. This is what one would expect these plots to
look like in the first place.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5e6d08e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5e6d08e">final thoughts</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5e6d08e">
<p>
Here are some notable aspects of fraud theries appearing to leverage math and/or data I've
noticed:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the analysis focuses on one year. What is the historical context for this metric? Is
this actually unique? What trends or patterns have existed over time?</li>
<li>the evaluation is conducted for only one candidate. Note what my plot would look like
above with Obama or McCain removed. Indeed, with only Trump shown and the many invented
examples slipped in of what these supposedly shood look like, it paints the picture that
the data is unique to Trump.</li>
<li>only instances unfavorable to a certain candidate are evaluated. While the analysis is
presented behind a mask of virtue and integrity… no justice is sought where the
desired result was obtained (yet the "suspicious" pattern occurred). In addition, if
pattern X means "fraud," how can it it appear everywhere?</li>
<li>lastly, the metric used (e.g. straight vs. direct-straight) is never justified; ask
yourself if you've ever heard what this relationship is <i>supposed</i> to be?</li>
</ul>
<p>
This last point is key. I'm sure a different term already exists for
this concept, but I've been thinking of this as "argument by inception." You were never
suspicious of this metric, pattern, ratio, etc. before someone told you it was odd. Once
suggested, it's hard to shake despite zero evidence being presented to justify it.
