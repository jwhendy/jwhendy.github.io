Welcome! This is the mind-dump repository for John W. Henderson. I'm an
engineer working in product development, and currently reside in St. Paul, MN, with my
wife and three kiddos. 

I created this primarily as an online portfolio, though I will likely migrate my [[http://jwhendy.blogspot.com/][blog]] here
as well. As I write this, I'm primarily just tickled that =github= offers hosting like
this, that I can write in my beloved [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] via [[https://getnikola.com/][Nikola]], and that I got it to work after
just one night and part of a day.

I've gone by /jwhendy/ (sometimes just /hendy/) for some time; you might see me on
[[https://bbs.archlinux.org/search.php?search_id=1747258675][the arch linux forums]], [[http://stackexchange.com/users/231647/hendy][StackExchange]], and [[https://github.com/jwhendy][github]] (to name a few).

I studied mechanical engineering, but see myself as quite a hodge-podge of iterests. I'm
into programming, electronics, data analysis and visualization, woodworking, various
crafty things, and home repair/improvement. I also enjoy playing piano and guitar, soccer, rock
climbing, hobby photography, and camping.

For some specifics on the electronics and software side of things:
- [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]]: a note-taking/todo/scheduling/code-writing/document generation add-on for the
  [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs text editor]]. I use this heavily at work and home and would say that it's the most
  revolutionary piece of software I've ever discovered!
- [[http://www.r-project.org/][R]]: a statistical programming language which I use for all of my data preparation,
  analysis, and plotting
- [[http://www.latex-project.org][\(\LaTeX\)]]: a document typesetting utility
- [[https://www.archlinux.org/][arch linux]]: I used to have a Macbook, but kids + water put that to an end. Linux makes
  open source software so easy to try, doesn't shove alert boxes in my face while I'm
  trying to work, and isn't starving for RAM and CPU.
- =python=: this is currently my "next big thing." I've been really enjoying several
  classes on [[http://www.coursera.org/][Coursera]], making some handy scripts, and even using it to program robots via
  [[http://www.ros.org/][ROS]].
- arduino, raspberry pi, et al: 
- data visualization: this is sort of meta, but since much of my programming outputs
  visuals, I group it in this category. If you can't understand or communicate the data,
  game over. I got interested in this topic thanks to the amazing site [[http://flowingdata.com/][FlowingData]].
