I've been presented with another theory of fraud in the 2020 Presidential election. Have a
look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1uyg1f0RNA">the video</a>, which compares snapshots of the election results as extracted from NY Times <code>.json</code>
files to "prove" that votes were switched and lost. This is done via some <code>python</code>
code we'll take a look at below. The video walks through this <a href="https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-11-11-election-data-analyzed-votes-switched-biden-software.html">Natural News post</a> in a very
lively and shout-splaining fashion. Bold claims are made, including:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>NY Times <code>.json</code> files are analogous to a "Flight Data Recorder (black box)" when it
comes to being official transaction logs of election night results</li>
<li>over 500k votes were switched from Trump to Biden</li>
<li>Bannon and Giuliani have confirmed whistleblowers from Dominion, a ballot counting
software company (that was on 11/11; the pattern is always the same: dangle some
mind-blowing tidbit and then we never hear about it again? Nevertheless,
for weeks I'll hear people citing "those Dominion whistleblowers they found")</li>
<li>a <a href="https://everylegalvote.com/country">fraud simulator </a> (spoiler: it just switches key states when you toggle between fraud
and no fraud scenarios, with no explanation of how it's calculating anything at all)</li>
<li>Trump and DoD personnel watched this fraud happen in real time, have it recorded, and
<i>allowed</i> the fraud to happen so they'd have proof (but still filed lawsuits <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/10/donald-trump-longshot-election-lawsuits">in five
states</a>, just to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/snell-maricopa/snell-wilmer-withdraws-from-election-lawsuit-as-trump-contests-arizona-results-idUSL1N2HY005">withdraw</a> from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/13/trump-law-firm-withdraws-pennsylvania-election-case">two</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>
In any case, we'll be focused on the data analysis and short answer: no, there's nothing
here folks.

While the 2020 election is behind us, this is not the case with interpretations. Theories
abound proposing how and why we can <i>know</i> that fraud is the overwhelming conclusion. One
such theory is contained in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRJCB6U-H4E">this video</a> by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva_Ayyadurai">Dr. Shiva</a>. The gist goes like this:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>in certain states, one may vote "straight ticket," which means making one choice to
select all same-party candidates on the ballot</li>
<li>one may also "direct vote," meaning one makes individual choices (which may or may not
be for all same-party candidates)</li>
<li>for a given party, there is an expected correlation between the percent of straight
ticket votes in an area (e.g. precinct, county) and direct votes for others of the same
party; deviating from this correlation implies fraud</li>
</ul>
<p>
Let's take a look!

I've used Arch linux for about 8 years from <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/profile.php?id=35588">what I can tell</a>. I love the minimalistic
nature, and also think <code>pacman</code> and <code>pacaur</code> are pretty great for package management. Arch
doesn't give me stuff I don't need, stays out of my way, and has <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/">fantastic
documentation</a>. That said, at work I need Ubuntu due to some pre-built binary availability
and the lack of desire to build all of them each time they update. I decided to go with
both so I could use Ubuntu for specific tasks and Arch for my daily driver.
</p>

<p>
I was curious if I could use <code>btrfs</code> to create one main shared space for both, choosing
which subvolume to mount at boot. This eliminates the need to partition the disk and guess
sizes for each. I also encrypt my drives, so it required the ability to create an
encrypted container on <code>btrfs</code> and point the bootloader to that specific container based
no which distro I was booting. Lastly, my newest company issued computer shipped with UEFI
and Secure Boot, which was entirely new to me.
</p>

<p>
About ~15hrs later, I've got base systems installed and am feeling pretty happy.

As mentioned in a <a href="https://jwhendy.github.io/blog/translating-r-to-python/">previous post</a>, I've been trying to pick up <code>python</code>, coming from mostly
using <code>R</code> over the past 5-7 years for data analysis, stats, and a lot of plotting. I found
<code>python</code>'s plotting landscape quite a bit more confusing than I expected, with tons of
options compared to the typical reigning <code>R</code> champions: <code>base</code>, <a href="http://lattice.r-forge.r-project.org/"><code>lattice</code></a>, and <a href="http://ggplot2.org/"><code>ggplot2</code></a>. 
</p>

<p>
Granted, there are a ton of other R contenders as well, such as <a href="https://plot.ly/r/"><code>plotly</code></a> and <a href="https://ramnathv.github.io/rCharts/"><code>rCharts</code></a>,
but the three above are the most common. I stick almost exclusively to <code>ggplot2</code>, and
rarely find something I can't do (granted, this is typical science-y stuff, not
infographics or really complicated stuff). To educate myself, I went through and plotted a
pretty standard dataset in various ways to see how one would do it in a bunch of <code>python</code>
libraries:

I've been using <code>R</code> for at least <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9057006/getting-strings-recognized-as-variable-names-in-r">5 years</a>. Lately, I've been trying to pick up <code>python</code> as
well, which is quite the learning experience! I've been through some tutorials (or pieces
of them) from <a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html"><i>think python</i></a> and <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/">lpthw</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python">classes on Coursera</a>. With some basics
under my belt, I started getting into <code>numpy</code> and <code>pandas</code>, which is where things got
tricky. I can vaguely recall a time in my <code>R</code> Padawan days when I had a sense of what I
wanted to do, but didn't know enough to even formulate the question correctly. I also find
I don't learn well by just reading docs. I want to poke and prod around, trying to wrap my
head around what I'm reading. For example, I ran across the the function <code>tolist()</code> via
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34898159/python-pandas-series-combine-the-rows">SO</a>, but have no idea how to interpret <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.tolist.html">this</a> as it is:
</p>

<pre class="example">
Series.tolist()
  Convert Series to a nested list
</pre>

<p>
I thought a <code>pd.Series</code> was just like an <code>R</code> vector; why would it be "nestable" in the
first place? What is a nested list and why do I want that? Some <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23748995/pandas-dataframe-to-list">examples</a> just show that it
converts from a <code>pd.Series</code> to a list. I don't see any "nesting," but then don't know what
that is.
</p>

<p>
In any case, the point is that instead of trying to just learn <code>pandas</code> in some linear
way, I thought it might be more effective to simply take some <code>R</code> code and translate it to
<code>python</code>. I know what I want to know and the tools I would use in <code>R</code>, so getting my brain
around how to do the same in <code>python</code> seemed like an interesting way to learn. Whatever I
pickup will be relevant (I'm already doing these sorts of tasks), and the learning is more
targetted (I'm extracting the small % of information I need vs. trying to digest things I
likely will never use).
