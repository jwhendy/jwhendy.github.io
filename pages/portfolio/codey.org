I started putting together a "layman's insurance analysis" at 3M in 2012. I was tired of
the shiny HR documents with a smiling couple huddled around a computer at the kitchen
table. In my mind, the data was simply unparsable; no human mind can look at a table of
premiums and deductibles and calculate on the spot which plan is best for some given
scenario of expenses.

I decided to do something better. Initially this took the form of simply plots which
showed the cross-over points for two plans:

#+attr_html: :width 50%

#+html: </div>

This was fine and dandy until plans adopted a "split" deductible for family plans. In this
scenario, some of the insurance choices would cover a single individual if he or she
accrued half of the family duductible. Plans went all multivariate, which required
something better than a line plot. Coincidentally, I had been learning R for perhaps a
year and [[https://shiny.rstudio.com/][=shiny=]] had just been released. Boom, a web app was born:

#+attr_html: :width 85%
[[../../img/insurance-viz.png]]
#+html: </a>
#+html: </div>

I've been updating some form of guide (web app and sometimes a companion presentation) for
6 years in a row (as of 2017).
