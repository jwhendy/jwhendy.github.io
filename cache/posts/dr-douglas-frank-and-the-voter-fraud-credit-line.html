A voter fraud theory strikes again! I have come to rather enjoy these, as if you just take
a deep breath and remember that there was no fraud, these amount to an interesting puzzle to solve. It's
just an episode of Penn &amp; Teller "Fool Us" where the goal is to figure out how the magician
does his trick. Instead of magic, we have math and data as the methods at work.

You can find the theory of Dr. Douglas G. Frank presented in a <a href="https://www.depernolaw.com/uploads/2/7/0/2/27029178/collective_response_to_motions_for_protective_order_040921.pdf">recent legal brief</a> from Attorney
Matthew DePerno (attorney for the Plaintiff, William Bailey v. Antrim County). You
can also listen to him walk through the brief in an interview <a href="https://rumble.com/vfjei7-interview-with-matt-deperno-on-new-explosive-evidence-submitted-in-michigan.html">on rumble</a>.

This was the most involved theory I've looked into, and the more I looked the more I
found, so I shifted to my more natural, full-on Org-mode habitat in order to reproducibly
analyze. The output is the PDF below, with code and data available <a href="https://github.com/jwhendy/dr-frank-voter-fraud">on github</a> if you'd like
to take a look yourself!
