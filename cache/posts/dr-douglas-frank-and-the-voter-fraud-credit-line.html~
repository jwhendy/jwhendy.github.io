A voter fraud theory strikes again! I have come to rather enjoy these, as if you just take
a deep breath and remember there was no fraud, these amount to a puzzle to solve. It's
just a game of Penn &amp; Teller "Fool Us" where the goal is to figure out how the magician
does his trick. Instead of magic, we have math and data as the tools in play.

You can find the theory of Dr. Douglas G. Frank presented in a <a href="https://www.depernolaw.com/uploads/2/7/0/2/27029178/collective_response_to_motions_for_protective_order_040921.pdf">recent legal brief</a> from Attorney
Matthew DePerno (attorney for the Plaintiff, William Bailey against Antrim County). You
can hear him walk through the brief in an interview <a href="https://rumble.com/vfjei7-interview-with-matt-deperno-on-new-explosive-evidence-submitted-in-michigan.html">on rumble</a> as well.

This was the most involved, and the more I looked the more I found, so I shifted to my
more natural, full-on Org-mode habitat in order to reproducibly analyze. The output is
this PDF, with code available <a href="https://github.com/jwhendy/dr-frank-voter-fraud">on github</a> if you'd like to take a look yourself!
