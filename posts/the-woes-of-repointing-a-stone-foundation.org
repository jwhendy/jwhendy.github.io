* background

This project started as many do: a lot simpler. We have an old, second back door that's
been peeling paint for some time. In addition, there was a smaller rectangle of 1/4" plywood
that someone decided to use as siding at some point. Over time, this rotted up about 6"
from the ground. Since the door and the siding were neatly tucked into this small section
on the back of the house I decided to just remove, sheath/housewrap, and re-side the whole
area.

When I got to work removing it, I found a lot of rotten wood under the threshold. More
alarming, under the door contained what might have been concrete at some point, or perhaps
mortarted stones. Now it was literally just moist dirt. I'd been planning to pour some new
sort of platform once I removed all the dirt/debris, and then put in some sort of sill
boards using treated lumber. I decided to remove some siding on the adjacent side of the
house so I could decide if I should wrap this pour around the corner.

There's a little 6" concrete "skirt" along our driveway, and a foot long section was
cracked away and loose. I got that removed and found an extremely loose stone foundation
looking at me. I was able to pull out quite a bit without even trying. I started reading
and found lots of mention of pointing stone foundations... but my goodness, the
instructions on mortar are some of the most ambiguous I've ever seen. I'm writing this to
keep track of the various links I've found as well as hopefully help others if and when I
find the answer.

Helpful references:
- [[http://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/cement/cement.htm][Building conservation]] on concrete as a lime mortar additive. Suggests that < 10% is
  bound to fail and one is better off relying purely on CO2 cure. Bunch of other articles
  there on [[http://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/limegauging/limegauging.htm][gauging materials]]
- Hard to read [[https://archive.org/stream/investigationone00carr/investigationone00carr_djvu.txt][paper]] with some ratios:

|   | lime | sand | dust                   |
|---+------+------+------------------------|
| 1 |    1 |    3 |                        |
| 2 |    1 |    3 | 1 (Williamsburg brick) |
| 3 |    1 |  2.5 | 1 (Williamsburg brick) |
| 4 |    1 |  2.5 | 1 (lime powder)        |
| 5 |    1 |  2.5 | 1 (Martin clay)        |

Results showed little difference in strength or water transmission between mixes (Martin
clay slightly improved vapor trans).


Just googling "repair a stone foundation" gets all of these:

DIY Chatroom listing
- [[http://www.diychatroom.com/f19/old-stone-foundation-repair-102132/index2/][Old stone foundation repair]]: guy says he's using Type N mortar and is told it's as bad
  as some foam insulation that's there, or worse due to being too hard and not
  breathable. Some vague references to mixes, but not much specific.

Some TScar quotes:

[[http://www.diychatroom.com/f19/old-stone-foundation-repair-102132/#post633837][Old stone foundation repair]]:
#+begin_quote
For a blended mortar, you can use Type S lime straight from the bag, for lime mortar, the
lime needs to be hydrated. Gently cover with water and keep covered with water for at
least 2 days, then pour off (and save) excess water and the lime is ready to be used. As
long as you keep it covered with water it will remain in a usable condition.

Interesting that a historic preservation agency says cement? References [[https://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/111682][this page]].
#+begin_quote
Also, the GSA "Historic Preservation" guidelines for Preparing Lime Mortar For Repointing
Masonry (using type S hydrated lime) advise using cement in all of the mortar mixes that
they have listed - the highest lime to cement ratio given is 3:1 for working on historic
masonry set in lime mortar:
