* background

While the 2020 election is behind us, this is not the case with interpretations. Theories
abound proposing how and why we can /know/ that fraud is the overwhelming conclusion. One
such theory is contained in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRJCB6U-H4E][this video]] by a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva_Ayyadurai][Dr. Shiva]]. The gist goes like this:
- in certain states, one may vote "straight ticket," which means making one choice to
  select all same-party candidates on the ballot
- one may also "direct vote," meaning one makes individual choices (which may or may not
  be for all same-party candidates)
- for a given party, there is an expected correlation between the percent of straight
  ticket votes in an area (e.g. precinct, county) and direct votes for others of the same
  party; deviating from this correlation implies fraud

Let's take a look!

Several early warning signs stood out to me ahead of actually digging into the proposed theory:

- MIT is slapped all over this, which I thought implied he was faculty until I re-looked
  in order to write this post.

- he includes a long preface citing his pedigree, degrees, and Fullbright scholarship
- the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva_Ayyadurai][wiki page]] on him refers to a past history of promoting conspiracies, and falsely
  claiming to have invented email
- his personal behavior after losing an election is [[https://web.archive.org/web/20201115165853if_/https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/ikyqep/shiva_is_an_unhinged_maniac_and_inciting_violence/][less than stellar]]

Nevertheless, we can take the data and reasoning on their own merits, though I think past
credibility and general conduct is relevant data to consider.

* the lead in

Dr. Shiva's strategy begins by planting seeds of doubt. For example, here he points out
the lack of traceability and verification abilities for voters:

He presents the aility of General Election Management System (GEMS) software to use
weighted votes (where a vote != 1), and to apparently display/calcualte fractional
votes. [[http://blackboxvoting.org/fraction-magic-2/][This work]] has been done by Black Box Voting, and led me down a bit of a rabbit
hole, and I admit that the wiki page on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_Election_Solutions][Premier Election Solutions]] doesn't instill
confidence, but this is a far cry from the type of investigation and evidence one would
need to show that any of these features or vulnerabilities was used to alter results.

Next, we're shown a table that supposedly comes from FOIA requests for various towns in
Massachusetts, showing that the number of votes recorded in the MA 2020 primary election
exceeded the number of voters on "participating voter lists" for 15 cities/downs he
audited.

Note that the raw data isn't provided, no context is given (what is a "participating voter
list"?),
