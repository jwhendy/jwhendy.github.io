Welcome! This is the mind-dump repository for John W. Henderson. I'm an
engineer working in product development, and currently reside in St. Paul, MN, with my
wife and three kiddos. 

I created this primarily as an online portfolio, though I will likely migrate my [[http://jwhendy.blogspot.com/][blog]] here
as well. As I write, I'm primarily just tickled that =github= offers hosting like
this, that I can write in my beloved [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] via [[https://getnikola.com/][Nikola]], /and/ that I got it to work after
just a few hours.

I've gone by /jwhendy/ (sometimes just /hendy/) for some time; you might see me on
[[https://bbs.archlinux.org/search.php?search_id=1747258675][the arch linux forums]], [[http://stackexchange.com/users/231647/hendy][StackExchange]], and [[https://github.com/jwhendy][github]] (to name a few).


* interests

I studied mechanical engineering, but see myself as quite a hodge-podge of iterests. I'm
into programming, electronics, data analysis and visualization, woodworking, various
crafty things, and home repair/improvement. I also enjoy playing piano and guitar, soccer, rock
climbing, hobby photography, and camping.

For some specifics on the electronics and software side of things:
- [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]]: a note-taking/todo/scheduling/code-writing/document generation add-on for the
  [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs text editor]]. I use this heavily at work and home and would say that it's the most
  revolutionary piece of software I've ever discovered!
- [[http://www.r-project.org/][R]]: a statistical programming language which I use for all of my data preparation,
  analysis, and plotting
- [[http://www.latex-project.org][\(\LaTeX\)]]: a document typesetting utility
- [[https://www.archlinux.org/][arch linux]]: I used to have a Macbook, but kids + water put that to an end. Linux makes
  open source software so easy to try, doesn't shove alert boxes in my face while I'm
  trying to work, and isn't starving for RAM and CPU.
- =python=: this is currently my "next big thing." I've been really enjoying several
  classes on [[http://www.coursera.org/][Coursera]], making some handy scripts, and using it to program robots via
  [[http://www.ros.org/][ROS]].
- arduino, raspberry pi, et al: I love the world of microcontrollers, sensors, and
  gadgets. It's so enjoyable to create something that mostly does your will!
- data visualization: this is sort of meta, but since much of my programming outputs
  visuals, I group it in this category. If you can't understand or communicate the data,
  game over. I got interested in this topic thanks to the amazing site [[http://flowingdata.com/][FlowingData]].

* the picture

If you're curious, that weird looking headshot was made with a 16x16 LED matrix I built
(the same one my son is shown blinding himself with on my [[https://jwhendy.github.io/portfolio/][portfolio page]]). I'll often
wonder if something can be done, and then /really/ want to do it if I don't see many
previous examples. Having build the LED panel, I had the idea to recreate a picture with
it. I wanted to know if I could break up a picture into pixel "chunks" (16x16 in my case),
send them to the panel, take pictures of each, and then put them back together. I also
wanted to know if it would work out... here's [[../img/led_head_shot_explained.jpg][a picture]] that better explains how it was made.

It turns out that you /can/ do this. I was surprised at the color differences between the
top half and bottom half (each tile is redder on top and bluer on the bottom). After
seeing the camera capture this, I had the vague recollection that I used half of one batch
of LEDs, ran out, and switched to a new batch for the second half! I might re-do this at
some point, but for now I'm happy enough with my proof of concept.
